msttcorefonts is a collection of free (gratis) microsoft corefonts,
subject to MS EULA.  The package is used by osg-display-data.

The original project for this rpm package was
http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/, which provides only a spec file, which
at build time would download the freely-redistributable .exe files for the
fonts, then extract and bundle the .ttf files.

That's fine if the binary rpms are never redistributed, but in order to
better satisfy the EULA we'll bundle the original .exe files and EULA also.
