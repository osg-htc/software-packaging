The OSG version of this package overrides glexec.conf with an
OSG-default version of it, adds a logrotate.d file to rotate
/var/log/glexec.log since the setup for that is in the install
instructions, and silences a couple of log warnings.

This package is based on the glexec.spec found at
  http://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/viewvc/mwsec/packaging/fedora/trunk/glexec.spec
