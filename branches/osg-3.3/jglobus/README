The upstream for this is github: jglobus/JGlobus.
EPEL also has this package, but there are two reasons we have our own spec file:

1) EPEL has separate spec files for EL 6 vs EL 7, and we'd like to avoid that
2) EPEL splits up jglobus into multiple packages, and there isn't really a
   clean upgrade path we can offer to users

We do take one patch from EPEL: jglobus-bc146.patch, which fixes the code to
work with bouncycastle 1.46 (the upstream code was written against the new
bouncycastle 1.47+ API).
