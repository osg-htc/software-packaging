# This RVF file allows you to override the defaults specified in
# /usr/share/globus/globus_gram_job_manager/globus-gram-job-manager.rvf
# Instead of editing that file, you should place changes here; they will
# be preserved on upgrade.
#
# Common RVF overrides include:
# - Setting a default memory requirement
# - Setting the default max CPU / wall time
# - Setting a default queue, or limiting the available queues.
