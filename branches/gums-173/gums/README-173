This branch is for SOFTWARE-173.  See the ticket for more details:

        https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-173

The idea was to break out a limited subset of jars required for a gums-client
install, without needing to bring in all the extra jars.

A minimal set of jars was moved out of 'gums' into a new gums-client-libs,
changing the package requirements from:

        gums-client  -> gums
        gums-service -> gums

to:
        gums-client  -> gums-client-libs
        gums         -> gums-client-libs
        gums-service -> gums


SOFTWARE-173 was abandoned for adding packaging complexity that was not worth
it for ~20M savings on client-only installs.
