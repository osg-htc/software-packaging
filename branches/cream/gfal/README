Packaging of the gLite project's libgfal.

There are two patches here:
1) A patch so automake can find the glite build macros that are compatible with the Fedora globus.
2) gsoap 2.7 that ships with EPEL5 generates code with an interface that is incompatible with gfal.  The interface is patched back to the old behavior.
