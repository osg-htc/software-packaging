This one's a bit weird.

PureTLS requires a hacked version of cryptix-asn1; they provide the source
tarball.  However, Globus has a forked version of this fork.

The following was done on March 2, 2012 to produce the tarball:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/dsl/cog/CVS export -r HEAD cryptix-asn1
tar zcf cryptix-asn1.tar.gz cryptix-asn1/
