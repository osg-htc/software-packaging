This is a pass-through package of the the tarball
that is maintained by GOC and provides following files:
- vomses 
- edg-mkgridmap.conf
- vomsdir (directory tree)
- GUMS config (which isn't quite pass-through, since we use the new format)


This means the GOC now needs to add the creation of the vomsdir tree.
This can be done with
osg-make-vomsdir --vomsdir vomsdir --vomses vomses
