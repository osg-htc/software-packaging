This package is to fix compatibility issue between voms (EMI) and voms (OSG).

This mostly relates to voms-proxy-init and the checking of AC certs.
Current it's unclear if the voms in epel accepts the environment variable:
VOMS_PROXY_INFO_DONT_VERIFY_AC=true
It does however accept the command line option:
--dont-verify-ac
