osg-condor-flock Configuration README

Documentation can be found at:

Two configuration files control the behavior of the OSG Flocking:
- /etc/condor/config.d/98_flock_hosts.conf 
  System Administrators should not edit this file.  It is full of Condor
  macros that will be updated when new flocking hosts are added

- /etc/condor/config.d/99_osg_flock.conf 
  Administrators should edit this in order to enable which hosts should
  be in flocked to.
