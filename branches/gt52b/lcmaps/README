This package is based upon the NIKHEF package:

https://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/repos/mwsec/packaging/fedora/trunk/

The SRPMs were not used due to the issue fixed by upstream r15293.

We also have to add "--enable-osg" to get OSG-style validation of VOMS servers (none).

Note that we have included a patch to fix a double-free in generic VOMS attributes.  This patch may be removed when we upgrade to 1.4.30 or later.
