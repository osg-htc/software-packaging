# lcmaps.db
# 
# This file is used to configure lcmaps, but it might be slightly
# confusing at first glance because it's configured differently when
# you use glexec (usually on worker nodes) and when you configure
# services to use lcmaps for mapping users. 
#
# In general, you need to modify up to three portions of this file
# unless you are doing unusual advanced configurations.
# 
# 1) The gumsclient module definition (in Section 1)
#    This is where you configure the GUMS host you are using. This is
#    true for both glexec and lcmaps for a service. (Ditto for the SAZ
#    host in the sazclient.)
# 2) The glexectracking module (in Section 1)
#    If you are using glexec, uncomment the glexectracking module
#    definition and edit appropriately. You should always uncomment
#    this for glexec but should always leave it commented if you haven't
#    installed glexec. 
# 3) glexec mapping policy (in Section 2)
#    You should select the proper policy for glexec, if you are using glexec.
#    Most sites will use the first policy.

# Mapping policies
#
# Each of these define how lcmaps is used in different scenarios. 
# The defaults are generally good.
# We've left the various glexec policies commented out--you need to
# choose one of the three policies. Most sites will use the first
# policy (verify proxy, gums client, glexectracking)
# 
# For the globus_gridftp_mapping and the osg_default mapping, we've
# shown how to add saz, if you are using it at your site. Uncomment
# that line if appropriate.

## Pick an appropriate policy from the ones below. Make sure that only
## one policy is uncommented--the other policies should be commented
## out. For example, if you want policy #1 (the most common), remove
## the hash mark two lines: just before "verifyproxy" and just before
## "gumsclient". 

## Policy 1: GUMS but not SAZ (most common)
#verifyproxy -> gumsclient
#gumsclient -> glexectracking

## Policy 2: GUMS & SAZ
#verifyproxy -> sazclient
#sazclient -> gumsclient
#gumsclient -> glexectracking

## Policy 3: grid-mapfile
#verifyproxy -> gridmapfile
#gridmapfile -> glexectracking
