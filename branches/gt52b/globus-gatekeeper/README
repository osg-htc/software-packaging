Source downloaded from 'http://bamboo.globus.org/browse/GT512-RPMCENTOS5-15/artifact/repo/centos/5/SRPMS/globus-gatekeeper-8.1-1.src.rpm'

I have added /etc/sysconfig/globus-gatekeeper which is sourced in the init script on startup.
This is for programs like lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface that require custom environment variables.

globus-gatekeeper has been patched to properly handle signals in a multithreaded environment
