This is a copy of the EPEL globus-gatekeeper.

I have added /etc/sysconfig/globus-gatekeeper which is sourced in the init script on startup.
This is for programs like lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface that require custom environment variables.

globus-gatekeeper has been patched to properly handle signals in a multithreaded environment
