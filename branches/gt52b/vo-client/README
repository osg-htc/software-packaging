This is a pass-through package of the the tarball
that is maintained by GOC and provides following files:
- vomses 
- edg-mkgridmap.conf
- vomsdir (directory tree)


This means the GOC now needs to add the creation of the vomsdir tree.
This can be done with
osg-make-vomsdir --vomsdir vomsdir --vomses vomses

For this revision, I have created
vo-client-38-1.tar.gz
in the upstream area that extends the existing tarball with the vomsdir directory.
