# This config file sets up the daemons for a single node install of HTCondor,
# where all the daemons required for running a pool of one machine are
# enabled.  This config is only useful for testing and experimentation.
#
# Once you are ready to add additional machines to your pool,
# refer to the HTCondor Administrators' Manual on the roles a machine
# can play [1] and how to configure those roles [2].
