This package is based upon the NIKHEF package:

https://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/repos/mwsec/packaging/fedora/trunk/
http://software.nikhef.nl/security/lcmaps/
http://software.nikhef.nl/dist/redhat/el5/mwsec/SRPMS/

The SRPMs were not used due to all the modifications we have put in.

We also have to add "--enable-osg" to get OSG-style validation of VOMS
servers (none).

Note that we have included a number of patches which may be removed when
we upgrade to 1.4.33 or later.
