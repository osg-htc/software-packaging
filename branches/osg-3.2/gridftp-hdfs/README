GridFTP-HDFS is a plugin for GridFTP that allows it to directly use an HDFS
file system as a backend. We originally got it directly from the developer
(Brian Bockelman at UNL). Looks like the project was sent to the Globus team,
who based their RPM off of our RPM.

Now we get it from Globus; it's not in EPEL, and is unlikely to be in EPEL
since it requires HDFS packages to build and HDFS is not in EPEL. The Globus
team has added several patches, some of which we can't use. They've also
conditionalized the build such that if the proper macro is defined, it will
build the way OSG wants it. I've had to adjust some of that, but we might be
able to send those changes back to the Globus team.
