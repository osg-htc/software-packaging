Three notes from the packager:
1) Added the Fedora-compatible glite m4 macros to the bootstrap script.
2) Could not find the GLITE_LIB64 macro; simply commented it out.
3) The build originally required the 'gridsite_globus' libs. In the current
   version of gridsite, the gridsite_globus libs are just copies of the
   gridsite libs, for compatibility. The EPEL version of the gridsite package
   removes the gridsite_globus libs, causing this build to fail, so I patched
   one of the makefiles to replace the gridsite_globus depedency with just
   gridsite.
