This package was created from the SRPM for npad found at:

http://software.internet2.edu/rpms/SRPMS/

The package does not follow many Fedora guidelines and only packages the server;
the client is included only as a .c file.  In May 2013, we learned that the OSG
does not use this package for the server, but does need the client.  So we added
a simple, minimally correct client subpackage (npad-client).  Therefore, this is
no longer a strict pass-through package, but the spec file is derived from the
one found in the upstream SRPM.
