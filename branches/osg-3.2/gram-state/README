Some comments about gram-state, initially added very much post facto by cat, on
the occasion of his being confused about the purpose of the package when moving
to OSG 3.2.0.

Brian Bockelman originally wrote a script called globus_state_parser for his own
use when debugging Globus gatekeepers.  He submitted the initial RPM in early
2012, and then Alain Roy did some clean up and a rename later that year.  The
JIRA ticket for this work is:

https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-639

The authoritative source now belongs to OSG Software and lives in our SVN repo:

$SVN/software/gram-state

Other than being mentioned in release notes, this tool is not documented on the
OSG TWiki.
