Upstream source RPM obtained from UW AFS:

  /p/condor/public/binaries/v$SERIES/$VERSION/condor-$VERSION-1.src.rpm

  (for VERSION=X.Y.Z and SERIES=X.Y)

For example:

  /p/condor/public/binaries/v8.2/8.2.5/condor-8.2.5-1.src.rpm


Instructions for updating upstream source:

  VERSION=8.2.5
  SERIES=${VERSION%.*}
  SRPM=condor-$VERSION-1.src.rpm
  PUBLIC_SRPM=/p/condor/public/binaries/v$SERIES/$VERSION/$SRPM
  UPSTREAM=/p/vdt/public/html/upstream/condor/$VERSION/

  mkdir -p $UPSTREAM
  cp $PUBLIC_SRPM $UPSTREAM

  echo condor/$VERSION/$SRPM > upstream/developer.srpm.source


You can also do this by running: ./pull-condor-srpm 8.2.5


Notes on updating osg/condor.spec:

If we are using our own version of condor.spec (which is the case if we are
carying any patches), it is a good idea to compare our version to the version
in the new upstream srpm.  This way we can catch any updates to the upstream
condor.spec.

Expected changes between our condor.spec and upstream's:
 - 'tarball_version' should be the same (if necessary, update it to match)
 - 'condor_base_release' in ours should get a .n (eg, 1.1 if upstream has 1)
 - PatchN/%patchN lines added for patches we carry
 - %changelog entries for OSG-specific changes
 - condor_build_id
 - any other tweaks we continue to add, which should be in the %changelog
