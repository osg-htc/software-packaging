Subject: [PATCH] db-upgrade-1.10-to-1.11

Fix 1.10 to 1.11 DB upgrade script

The DB upgrade script errors out when modifying the `buildroot` table
due to the following reason:
- a new constraint is added to make sure container_type and
  container_arch are either both NULL or neither NULL
- the container_type column is new in 1.11, so when the migration script
  adds it, all the values are NULL
- the container_arch column is a renaming of the arch column, where arch
  (for us) is either "i386" or "x86_64", never NULL
These cause the constraint to immediately fail.

Fix by setting container_type to 'chroot' (which is the container type
the koji code adds for mock builds) where container_arch is non-NULL.
