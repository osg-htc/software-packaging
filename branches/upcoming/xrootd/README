This build includes "compat" packages that are built from the XRootD 4 sources.
To update the compat packages:

**Steps:**
- Download the source from xrootd.org: follow the link in the announcement email, then click the "Source" link.
  Or use http://xrootd.org/download/v${VERSION}/xrootd-${VERSION}.tar.gz
  (where ${VERSION} is the new version of XRootD 4)

  If you can't use that URL for some reason (e.g. permission denied), download the archive from GitHub
  by finding the appropriate tag: https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/tags

- Put the tarball in the usual upstream area and update "xrootd-compat.tarball.source"

- Edit "osg/xrootd.spec" and update the "%define compat_version" line

- Bump the release and add %changelog entry

- Build
