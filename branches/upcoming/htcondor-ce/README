The HTCondor-CE provides a remote interface to the local batch system.
It is comparable to other gatekeeper software (such as GRAM or CREAM), but is
entirely built out of HTCondor components.  It is a special configuration of
HTCondor and has no daemon components not provided by the HTCondor team.

The spec file is from the HTCondor-CE source code itself.  Updates done in the
OSG should be sent back upstream; there are no known reasons to have the two
copies be different.

To build from upstream:

git archive --prefix=htcondor-ce-{VERSION}/ {GIT REVISION} | gzip -9 > htcondor-ce-{VERSION}.tar.gz

(note that the tarball used in 1.6-2 was built from
https://github.com/matyasselmeci/condor-ce
)
