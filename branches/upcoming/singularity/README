Packaging of the Singularity container service

## Generating the tarball

Generate the source tarball by checking out the singularity source, checkout a tag, and build dist:

    git clone https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git
    cd singularity
    git checkout 2.2
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make dist

The spec file is also generated by the `make dist` command.
