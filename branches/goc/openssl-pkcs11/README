This version is built entirely for OASIS purpose in the osg-development because 
the latest libp11 package from EPEL does not work properly on the oasis & oasis-itb machines.
Source rpm has been dowloaded and tar exctracted to the OSG SOFTWARE upstream directory at Wisconsin.
Check osg/ and upstream/ folder for furhter reference or see OO-220.
