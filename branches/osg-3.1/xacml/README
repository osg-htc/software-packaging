This is a repackage of upstream plus one patch, xacml_namespaces.patch.

xacml_namespaces.patch does two things:
1) Renames namespaces -> xacml_namespaces
2) Explicitly sets the namespace of struct soap to xacml_namespaces.

HTCondor also exports a global variable named 'namespaces'; without this
patch, HTCondor will clobber xacml's 'namespaces' global variable,
resulting in difficult-to-debug GUMS issues.
