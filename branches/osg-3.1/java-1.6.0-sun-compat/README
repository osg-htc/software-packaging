This package is almost a pass-through of the java-1.6.0-sun-compat in
the SL repo (originally JPackage repo).  The only differences are the
use of the -29 JDK instead of -24 and building for the i386 arch.

We pass it through because it is not present in RHEL 5 or CentOS 5,
only in SL5, but we want to ensure we always have it.
