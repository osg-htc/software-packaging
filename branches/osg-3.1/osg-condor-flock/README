This package contains HTCondor configuration files that define flocking hosts
for the OSG glideinWMS VO frontends.  It is used by VOs that wish to flock jobs
to the OSG; the main user is OSG-XSEDE.  In addition to the config files, the
package acts as a meta-package, requiring HTCondor itself, the mandated Gratia
HTCondor probe, and grid certificates.

Derek Weitzel developed the package for the OSG Campus Grids area, especially
OSG user support (mostly Mats Rynge).
