This is the lcmaps-plugins-static-mapping package.

This is a plugin for LCMAPS which has a static mapping policy;
if user X invokes LCMAPS, then this plugin will always return 
user Y as the result.  The primary use of this plugin is for
glexec at sites which use per-slot users (a HTCondor feature).

To our knowledge, this is only used at UCSD.

The mapping from X to Y is controlled by a mapfile, documented
here:

This package is based on a SRPM from the Nebraska Koji.  If
any future edits are needed, we should fork it and maintain it
in the osg/ directory.
