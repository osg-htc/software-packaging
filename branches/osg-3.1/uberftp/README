I had to tweak the Subversion source RPM from EPEL heavily for two
reasons:

1) The EPEL RPM built fine against Globus 5.0 but not Globus 5.2. It now
builds just fine against Globus 5.2. The biggest change was a patch to
UberFTP's configure.ac, with a bit in the SPEC file. In both cases, I
removed references to Globus flavors, and I also removed the use of
some GPT tools that don't work so well in Globus 5.2 (and just aren't
needed.) 

2) I updated from UberFTP 2.4 to 2.6.

You can download UberFTP from the developer's web page at:

UberFTP now builds fine against Globus 5.2.5 albeit with a tweak in
configure.ac necessary for 32-bit systems to work, but a full patch is
not necessary.  It has been updated to 2.8, which was downloaded from
the project's new GitHub repo.  EPEL is still several versions behind.
