This is a pass-through of upstream.

Previous builds had a patch called xacml_namespaces.patch that did two
things:

1) Renamed namespaces -> xacml_namespaces
2) Explicitly set the namespace of struct soap to xacml_namespaces

The original reason for the patch was because HTCondor also exported a
global variable named `namespaces' and would clobber xacml's global of
the same name, resulting in difficult-to-debug GUMS issues.

In xacml 1.5.0, namespaces had already been renamed to
xacml_soap_namespaces so this patch is no longer necessary.
