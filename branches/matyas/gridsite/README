Gridsite was brought in because the EPEL version removes the
libgridsite_globus shared libraries, which are needed for
glite-data-util-c (and thus glite-fts-client, which is in the
wn-client).  See SOFTWARE-1298 and SOFTWARE-1348.

Note this is the EL 7 version, which does not include the compat
(gridsite-1.X) libraries.
