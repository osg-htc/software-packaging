condor-unified-repos sets up the yum repositories required to install
development versions of the unified condor rpm.

This includes:

 - condor-unified-development (only the unified condor packages)
 - condor-unified-development-build (osg-upcoming-development packages as well)

The osg-release is designed for both el5 and el6.  It only installs the
appropriate repo files for the platform.

By default, these repos are not enabled.  This can be changed by 
editing the yum.repos.d/el*-condor-unified*.repo files and setting:
enabled=1
