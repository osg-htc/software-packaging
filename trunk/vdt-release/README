vdt-release is the yum repository setup required to install VDT software.  
This release includes:
 - Production (named 'vdt') (default)
 - Testing
 - Development

By default, only the Production repo is enabled.  This can be changed by 
editing the yum.repos.d/vdt-*.repo files and setting:
enabled=1
