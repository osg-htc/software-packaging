SRPM downloaded from jpackage at http://www.jpackage.org/browser/rpm.php?jppversion=6.0&id=12879
This is the package for EL6, but I have been able to rebuild it for EL5 as well.

maven is an interesting package in that it has itself as a build dependency.
When the version of maven that you are building changes, you must follow these steps:
    - edit the spec file and set the %bootstrap macro to 1.
    - commit, build.
    - edit the spec file, set the %bootstrap macro to 0 and bump the release.
    - commit, build.
