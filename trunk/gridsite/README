This is a straight passthrough of gridsite from EPEL.

Source downloaded from:
  http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/packages/gridsite/2.2.0/2.el6/src/gridsite-2.2.0-2.el6.src.rpm

Per https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1348, we are no longer
maintaining the osg version with the gridsite_globus shared library restored.
However, since the EPEL gridsite is built against openssl 1.0.1e, we need to
rebuild gridsite against the openssl 1.0.0 that we ship.

Hopefully in OSG 3.3 we will not need to ship either openssl or gridsite.
