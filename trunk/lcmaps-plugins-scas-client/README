This is a repackage of upstream, plus two packages:

1) ca_only.patch: When HTCondor invokes LCMAPS, it will erroneously give
   a handle with only CAs present.  While this is invalid behavior, without
   this patch, the plugin segfaults.
2) log_xacml_errors.patch: libxacml will log all interesting failure messages
   to stderr; scas-client redirects stderr to /dev/null.  With this patch,
   the stderr of libxacml will be logged with the lcmaps_log facility.
