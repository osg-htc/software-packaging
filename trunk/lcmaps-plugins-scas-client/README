This is a repackage of upstream, with basically the only diffference
being an "Obsoletes: lcmaps-plugins-saz-client" to force that old
subrpm to be removed.

Source rpm comes from
    http://software.nikhef.nl/dist/mwsec/rpm/epel5/SRPMS/
and the .spec source comes from
    http://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/viewvc/mwsec/packaging/fedora/trunk/lcmaps-plugins-scas-client.spec
