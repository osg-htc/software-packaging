Apparently we package this because it is not in SL 5.6.
It _is_ in RHEL 5, Centos 5 and SL 5.8, so we can stop shipping it pretty soon.

We are using python-simplejon 2.0.9. Newer versions don't work with
Python 2.4, so we're not using it there. 

We don't need it for SL6/Python 2.6 because it's built in.
