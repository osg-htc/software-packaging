This is a new package for GUMS.  Notes:

1) The maven auto-generated RPM was not used.  Too far from FHS standards.
2) I had to hand-remove a few maven plugins (RPM and release).  These aren't required for packaging.
3) JARs are currently in the wrong location.  We'll work with upstream to get them in the right place there first.
4) gums-host-cron was largely rewritten to remove $VDT_LOCATION.
5) There are two significant patches:
  a) We fetch the client certificate from the SSL auth chain, instead of the first certificate (which may be a proxy).
  b) We extract and record the VOMS extensions in the proxy in the SSL auth chain (if present).
