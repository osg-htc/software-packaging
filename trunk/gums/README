This is a new package for GUMS.  Notes:

1) The maven auto-generated RPM was not used.  Too far from FHS standards.
2) I had to hand-remove a few maven plugins (RPM and release).  These aren't required for packaging.
3) JARs are currently in the wrong location.  We'll work with upstream to get them in the right place there first.
