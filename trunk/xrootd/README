If a passthrough is done.

If not then Tarball obtained from:
http://xrootd.org/dload.html

And try to keep the spec as close to the one on epel. In case of doubts of packaging check:
https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/blob/master/packaging/rhel/xrootd.spec.in

To get the upstream:

git clone https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd.git
cd xrootd
git archive v4.8.0-rc1 | gzip -7 > xrootd-4.8.8-rc1.tar.gz

Or just do:

git clone https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd.git
cd xrootd 
git archive v4.8.0-rc1 --format=tar.gz --prefix=xrootd-4.8.0-rc1/ -o ~/xrootd-4.8.0-rc1.tar.gz -9


To build a tarball with patches adapt the following (adding patches to xrootd
4.8.4)

cd xrootd
git checkout v4.8.4
git checkout -b software3412

cherry pick and apply patches from PR811
git cherry-pick a807fb291cc39ef573d8014953372fe1ae7ef9f7
git cherry-pick 355e207c3d2bf9f0523d159dd37dbc229c81ba57

generate and save patch file:

git diff -u v4.8.4 > ~/src/osg/trunk/xrootd/osg/SW3412.patch

Alter spec to include patch

Patch0: SW3412.patch

Add following to %prep in spec file

%patch -p0
