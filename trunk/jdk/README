This package was created by running rpm-ripper from the osg-build-1.1.4
package on jdk-6u31-linux-amd64.rpm and jdk-6u31-linux-i586.rpm from
Oracle.  I removed the ExclusiveArch lines from the spec files and instead
wrapped the 32-bit spec file in %ifarch i386/%endif, and wrapped the 64-bit
spec file in %ifarch x86_64/%endif, and catted them together.

I also had to modify the Source lines. I made the 32-bit tarball be Source0 and
the 64-bit tarball be Source1 in both halves of the combo spec file. Then I
changed the %setup macros in the %prep step to uncompress the appropriate
tarball. Before this change, 'rpmbuild -bs' (which is done by osg-build) only
put one of the tarballs into the SRPM.

A future version of rpm-ripper will be able to automate all this: see
#SOFTWARE-279.
