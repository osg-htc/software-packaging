NOTE: the "BuildArch: noarch" lines were commented-out in the osg/xrootd.spec file
because Koji gets confused when it sees those lines and thinks that they are supposed to
apply to the entire package, leading to errors like this

    $ osg-build koji --scratch xrootd4
    ...
    124773 build (osg-el6, xrootd4-4.0.3-1.1.osg.el6.src.rpm): open (kojibuilder3.chtc.wisc.edu) -> FAILED: BuildError: error building package (arch noarch), mock exited with status 1; see build.log for more information
