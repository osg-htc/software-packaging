This is a repackaging of a tarball that is provided by the GOC.
We provide the following files and dirs:
    edg-mkgridmap.conf
    gums.config.template
    vomsdir/
    vomses

The GOC's package also provides a gums template config,
but the one we want to ship is in the new GUMS config format.

The following steps were used to create the vo-client-43 tarball:

1. Get vo-package-43.tar.gz from http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/, untar it.
2. Rename edg-mkgridmap.osg to edg-mkgridmap.conf
3. Get rid of gums.template and gums-fqan.txt
4. Copy gums.config.template from the previous vo-client package
5. Move vomsdir out of the way (if present)
6. Copy vomsdir from previous vo-client package.
7. Run ./osg-make-vomsdir --vomsdir vomsdir --vomses vomses;
   you will need to either run this as root on a machine that has host certs,
   or run it as yourself using your grid credentials.
8. Merge vomsdir dir with the one you moved out of the way.
9. Get rid of the scripts and anything else that's not mentioned in the spec file.
10. Rename the directory vo-client-$version
11. Tar up the directory into vo-client-$version-osg.tar.gz

Tim's notes, 1 November 2012

The process by which this version was created is completely broken and must
be fixed!  Simply copying the gums.config.template from the prior version
means that we lose any changes that Rob makes in the upstream, old-format
version.  So, I will work with Rob Quick and the GOC to create and document
a sustainable process for future releases.
