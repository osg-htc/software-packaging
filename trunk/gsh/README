To get an updated version of gsh:

1) Get the name of the tag
2) git clone https://github.com/tiradani/gsh.git
3) git tag -l
4) git checkout v0.1
5) tar czf gsh.tar.gz gsh/bin gsh/osg_gsh/ gsh/LICENSE gsh/README
6) Copy the gsh.spec to our repo. Edit it if needed. I needed to:
   - Tweak the release to include the %{?dist} . 
   - %doc README LICENSE
   Hopefully these will be pushed upstream soon.
