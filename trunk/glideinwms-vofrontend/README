Package: glideinwms-vofrontend

This is a glideinWMS VO Frontend package for OSG.

We are re-publishing the srpm, taken from
http://koji.hep.caltech.edu/public/packages/glideinwms-vofrontend/2.5.1/11/src/glideinwms-vofrontend-2.5.1-11.src.rpm

The spec file is taken directly from the upstream SRPM, so we don't have one in the osg subdir.

More details:
