GENERAL INFORMATION

This HTCondor is used built by the spec file adapted from fedora's system:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=condor.git

This was repackaged from Fedora because fedora split out the condor_procd, which
is required by the wn/client/somewhere...

Further, since it is from Fedora, we can follow fedora's packaging and updates.


CREATING THE UPSTREAM SOURCE TARBALL

We create the upstream source tarball for a HTCondor release directly from the
CHTC git repository.  The following process was tested with HTCondor 7.6.5:

1. Create and change to a temporary working directory

2. Get a copy of the public repository:

   git clone http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/repos/condor.git

3. Change into the resulting "condor" directory

4. Tell git to create a source tarball for a tagged release:

   git archive --prefix=condor-[VERSION]/ [GIT-TAG] | gzip -9 > [PATH]/condor-[VERSION].tar.gz

   Where:

   - [VERSION] is the dotted form of the HTCondor release; e.g., "7.6.5"
   - [GIT-TAG] is the git tag for the release; e.g., "V7_6_5"
   - [PATH] is the path to where you want to write the source tarball

5. Verify that the tarball was created correctly; for example, each path in the
   tarball should start with something like "condor-7.6.5/", and the whole
   tarball is likely to be about the same size as prior ones

6. Upload the source tarball to the correct upstream path, e.g.:

   /p/vdt/public/html/upstream/condor/7.6.5/condor-7.6.5.tar.gz
