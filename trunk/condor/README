CREATING THE UPSTREAM SOURCE RPM

We create the upstream source rpm for a HTCondor release directly from the
CHTC git repository.

1. Create and change to a temporary working directory

2. Get a copy of the public repository:

   git clone http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/repos/condor.git

   Or, if you have access to UW AFS:

   git clone /p/condor/repository/CONDOR_SRC.git condor

3. Change into the resulting "condor" directory

4. Create a source rpm for a tagged release:

   ./build/packaging/srpm/makesrpm.sh --condor-release VERSION

   Where VERSION is the dotted form of the HTCondor release; e.g., "8.2.4"

   You should find the new src.rpm in the current directory, named something
   like condor-8.2.4-1.el6.src.rpm

5. Upload the source tarball to the correct upstream path, e.g.:

   /p/vdt/public/html/upstream/condor/8.2.4/condor-8.2.4-1.el6.src.rpm
