This Condor is used built by the spec file adapted from fedora's system:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=condor.git

This was repackaged from Fedora because fedora split out the condor_procd,
which is required by the wn/client/somewhere...

Further, since it is from Fedora, we can follow fedora's packaging and 
updates.

NOTE:
The Source0 is inside an 'if'.  Therefore, vdt-build has problems detecting which name to use (just uses the first, which is from a git build).  See http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-147
