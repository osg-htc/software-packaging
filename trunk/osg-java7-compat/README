This is a minimal metapackage that requires java >= 1:1.7.0 and provides
java7, and does the same for the -devel equivalents.

This is written to support osg packages that currently require java7 /
java7-devel, which the latest version of java-openjdk from RedHat has
removed, and now provides java / java-devel = 1:1.7.0 instead.
