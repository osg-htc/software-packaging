This is the pass-through packaging of SLF4J, based on the jpackage repo work.

This was originally done by Brian Bockelman in order to fulfill a jetty dep.

SPEC file and sources are adopted from the jpackage 5.0 source RPM.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
	This build was re-done by Doug Strain to fix problems with 
	SL6 builds.  It now uses maven22.  Please note that the 
	version of slf4j in the sl6 repos is newer than this version
	so the sl6 version WILL NOT BE SHIPPED.  It currently builds
	on sl6 but this functionality is not guaranteed.
