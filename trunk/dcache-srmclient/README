RPM packaging of the SRM-Client-Fermi

Notes:
- Source code taken from: "svn export http://svn.dcache.org/dCache/tags/srmclient-1.9.5-23"
  - I tried to see if I could trim the fat some (includes a complete copy of dCache and its externals).  No luck
  - A truly heroic effort would be to split out the proper deps
- Currently, we patch out the assumption that the client scripts are in $SRM_PATH.
- Judging from dcache.org docs, this RPM should be called "dcache-srmclient" or "srmclient".
