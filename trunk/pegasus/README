Passthrough of source RPM from
http://download.pegasus.isi.edu/wms/download/rhel/src/pegasus-4.0.0-1.src.rpm

It has a dist in it, so we don't even need to tweak the spec file. At
least, in general. We had to rebuild 4.0.0 because Mats had already
built it, but it wasn't signed. In the future, we can just pass it
through.
