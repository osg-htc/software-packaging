Passthrough rebuild of openssl-1.0.0-27 from centos, downloaded from:

http://vault.centos.org/6.4/updates/Source/SPackages/openssl-1.0.0-27.el6_4.2.src.rpm

We are keeping this build around in osg-internal for now, as the new
openssl-1.0.1 may cause some problems for us...

NOTE: This package MUST NOT be built for el5! el5 uses OpenSSL 0.9.8 so putting 1.0.1 in breaks everything.

HISTORY: OpenSSL 1.0.1 came out in RHEL 6.5 and spread to the other EL6s.
Building an RPM against OpenSSL 1.0.1 renders it uninstallable (due to shared
library version dependencies) on systems with older OpenSSL versions (1.0.0, on
EL < 6.5).  However, most RPMs built against OpenSSL 1.0.0 work on an OpenSSL
1.0.1 install. The notable exception is Globus GRAM, but we have a workaround
in place (see <http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-489> and also
<http://jira.globus.org/browse/RIC-239>).

Until we decide to stop support for EL 6.0 -- 6.4, we must build our RPMs
with this version of OpenSSL on EL 6.
