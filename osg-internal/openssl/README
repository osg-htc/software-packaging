Passthrough rebuild of openssl-1.0.0-27 from centos, downloaded from:

http://vault.centos.org/6.4/updates/Source/SPackages/openssl-1.0.0-27.el6_4.2.src.rpm

We are keeping this build around in osg-internal for now, as the new
openssl-1.0.1 may cause some problems for us...

NOTE: This package MUST NOT be built for el5! el5 uses OpenSSL 0.9.8 so putting 1.0.1 in breaks everything.
