osg-release is the yum repository setup required to install OSG software.
This release includes:
 - Production (named 'osg') (default)
 - Testing
 - Development
 - Minefield (Directly off koji)
 - Pre-Release (Directly off koji)
 - Upcoming
 - Upcoming Testing
 - Upcoming Development
 - Upcoming Minefield (Directly off koji)
 - Upcoming Pre-Release (Directly off koji)
 - Contrib
 - Empty

By default, only the Production repo is enabled.  This can be changed by
editing the /etc/yum.repos.d/osg-*.repo files and setting:
enabled=1

This is an arch-specific fork of osg-release for the x86_64_v2 microarchitecture.
This is necessary because the arch needs to be hardcoded into the repo files,
as opposed to relying on the '$basearch' variable, because even on x86_64_v2
installs, $basearch expands to "x86_64", which is the repository that the
x86_64 microarch v3 RPMs are kept in (which are not compatible).

This only affects EL10.
